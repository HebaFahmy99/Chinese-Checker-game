We used HTML and a little CSS for implementing and styling a gameboard of 
two players each with one set. And the programming language we used 
for the coding part was the JavaScript and little Document object model (DOM).

To run the code:
1- download the files on your machine 
2- just open the File with HTML extension and click right and choose from the menu "Open in Browser".
3- it will re-direct you to the game 

Note:
First you will get a prompet in the top to choose which difficulity level you want to go through,
After you write the level, if you choose "Hard" and play your turn , it may takes extra time for the PC 
to choose the best move.

Heuristic Function we used:
stateEstimate function gives a score for the given state of a board. To use for evaluating
states in minimax searching. As a minimax evaluation for a state we take the difference between the distances each player is towards
winning.The maximizing player (PC) tries to minimize its own distance, while making sure the minimizing
player (HUMAN) doesn't decrease its distance.
